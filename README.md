# DSCI 511: Data acquistion and pre-processing
## College of Computing and Informatics <br> Drexel University
### Welcome to DSCI 511!
This is a first course in graduate level data science at Drexel University focused on early phases of work in the data science lifecycle. 

## Course Description
Introduces the breadth of data science through a project lifecycle perspective. Covers early-stage data-life cycle activities in depth for the development and dissemination data sets. Provides technical experience with data harvesting, acquisition, pre-processing, and curation.  Concludes with an open-ended term project where students explore data availability, scale, variability, and reliability.
College/Department: College of Computing & Informatics
- Credits: 3
- Restrictions: None
- Prerequisites: None

## Course Purpose within a Program of Study
This course provides a high-level view of what data is, where it comes from, and how it is used to render insight and support technical products. After introducing the breadth of steps that data scientists take throughout the lifecycle of a project, hands-on and in-depth experience is provided with several early-stage steps that interact closely, and often require iteration before later steps can be approached. 
This course is a core course in the Data Science Masters program.
## Statement of Expected Learning
The course objectives are to:
- obtain an overview of what data is, where it comes from, and what data science entails;
- understand of the range of activities essential to a data science project’s lifecycle;
- apply technical methods in data collection, construction, and curation; and
- execute a data collection/curation project exploring lifecycle stage interdependence and iteration. 

As learning outcomes, students completing this course should be able to use their understanding of project lifecycles, data sources and availability, acquisition and harvesting, pre-processing, and data management to curate data sets of high value that are in alignment with down-stream project goals.

- Python Data Science Handbook (PDSH). ISBN: 978-1491912058, O’Riley, November 2016
- The Data Science Handbook (TDSH). ISBN:9781119092940, John Wiley & Sons, 2017

### Required and Supplemental Materials and Technologies
Note: instructions and discussion of the following materials and technologies are provided in Chapter 0 of the course lecture notes (below). Students are expected to have the following by the start of the first week:
- A Github account: https://www.github.com
- A command line environment with Python (version 3) installed
- The Jupyter notebooks interactive development environment

### Lecture Notes
The primary course materials consist of a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks, which may be found on the course blackboard website and on the following private Github repository:
- http://github.com/jakerylandwilliams/DSCI511/

For access to the Github repository, all students are required to sign up for an account and post user names on the course discussion board. An invite to the Github repository will follow.

The course lecture notes are broken down into the following topics, which roughly correspond to a week of content each. More information on course scheduling can be found in that section, below.
- Chapter 0: System configuration and processing fundamentals
- Chapter 1: Introduction, process, and getting started with data
- Chapter 2: Data types and structures: different data, different challenges
- Chapter 3: Established collections: databases, dumps, and APIs
- Chapter 4: Pre-processing considerations: foresight for downstream needs 
- Chapter 5: Harvesting content from the world wide web
- Chapter 6: Data integration and enrichment
- Chapter 7: Building and maintaining a robust acquisition stream
- Chapter 8: Establishing a database with documentation
- Chapter 9: Distribution, accessibility, and data sharing

### Assignments, Assessments, and Evaluations

#### Homework 
Four structured, individual assignments:
1. Data science programming
2. APIs and pre-processing
3. Web scraping and data integration
4. Disseminating a data processing tool

#### Project 
One open-ended group assignment will have two phases:
1. Proposal for Data Set Construction and Potential for Use
2. Implementation of Data Set Construction with Documentation and Dissemination

### Course Schedule
The course’s schedule follows the lecture notes at roughly one week per chapter with the expectation that students will configure systems and review or work through the processing fundamentals in Chapter 0. Some chapters may extend over multiple weeks, depending the section’s pace. Week 10 and the regularly scheduled final exam period (to be determined) are reserved for final project presentations. Please observe the following (tentative) schedule, and be aware that weekly may change depending on the pace of class.
