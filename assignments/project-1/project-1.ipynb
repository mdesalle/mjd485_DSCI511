    "Welcome to your term project! This is the first portion of a two-part, open-ended team assignment that will culminate in a presentation during the last week of class or the regularly scheduled final exam period. Overall, this term project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with building a complex dataset and making it available. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The construction, acquistion, integration, enrichment, and distribution of a project-motivated and computationally significant dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first report on your team's project will constitue a discussion of what the dataset is that you want to build/access/create, why you believe it will be possilbe to conduct, and how long you believe it will take to build, in addition to discussion of the sorts of tasks that will be involved. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples potential dataset uses, whether academic or commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: All reports should inclue a high level abstract/discussion in a tone that is set for a completely diverse audience.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__Important__: because your project reports will have discussion intermingled with data and code as output, I not only request the  submission of your work in Jupyter Notebooks format, but additionly recommend conducting your work as a group collaboratively in Jupyter notebooks."

The courses of different projects will require overcoming different obstacles, and success in a data science project is ultimately a (partial) function of a team's abaility to adapt to project needs. However, all work should be well documented, articulately presented, and justified. If at any point it is unclear what to do or how to represent your project's work, please do not hesitate to ask your instructor for direction."

Data science is often conducted in teams, with different team members covering the diversity of knowledge and skills relevant to the different areas that a project must support to succeed. Even though our course is only focused on early-phase data science tasks (data set development), be sure to consider the strengths of your teamates and interests for gaining experience in dataset construction&mdash;if you want extensive experience with web scraping, pitch a project about this with a few other interested points. It will help to discuss interests. Be sure to write out the names of the project team's members in your first report and answer the two questions:\n",

Ultimately, please make sure that some portion of your target data are guarenteed to be collectable.
