    "There are no pre-requesites for this course but we will be getting off of the ground fast with programming. So, if you do not have programming experience or are unfamiliar with the Python syntax, please consider following the (10 hr) online Python course from codecademy to get in the swing of things before week 1.\n",

    "## 0.1 System Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a few free software technologies throughout this course, mostly doing data science in Python, but with some linux/unix command line tools in the background, at least to set things up. If you do anything before week 1 please be sure to get your system up and running! Before beginning work in this course you are required to set up __Python 3 with Jupyter notebooks__.

    "\n",
    "Git on its own is a type of version control software that software developers use to maintain a record of the versions of their code. On the other hand, [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is an online socialization of this software that allows teams of programmers to work on code together by maintaining versions in a coordinated repository. One very important side effect of GitHub that we'll leverage is:\n",

    "These lecture notes are being presented in a hybrid markdown-code-data format known as a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for a multimedia exposition for which GitHub provides very nice support. So, in addition to being a repository through which I can distribute lecture notes, assignments, and data, it's also an online space in which you can view these materials in a rendered format. Note: in the interest of simplicity I will not be requiring assignment submission via GitHub or the use of Git(Hub) for group work collaboration. While I support any efforts along these lines, any Git command usage will have to be independently learned.\n",

    "#### 0.1.2.1 What is Jupyter?\n",
    "In brief, Jupyter is an html-based development environment with extensive markdown capabilities. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive development interface with language-specific kernels. These allow developers to explore programming with objects held persistently in memory. Python was the flagship language for Jupyter (nee IPython), and has grown around an extensive suite of modules for analysis and visualization. These together with Jupyter make for an excellent suite of tools for exploratory data analysis and data-driven report generation. These lecture notes are being presented as a Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 0.1.3.2 Setting up a command line environment\n",
    "If you're more adventurous you might like to download your versions of python and manange environments yourself using command line utilities. These differ across operating systems and also might require some setup. Even though we won't be using command line utilities much in this course, and even if you're going to use Anaconda, it's still a good idea to get your working enviornment set up with some helpful command line tools, but its ok if this takes a bit more time to gel. Even though we're working in Jupyter notebooks to learn, explore, share, and prototyle for data science, its still generally best to deploy code in scripts and using bash/shell commands from a command line. \n",
