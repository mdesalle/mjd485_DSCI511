As a follow up, combine the line-by-line file reading syntax introduced in Section 1.4.1.5 in conjunction with the `json.dumps()` string serialization function in Section 1.4.2.2 to _read only the first ten lines_. As you read these lines, load each from json and print the laureate's list of prizes."
