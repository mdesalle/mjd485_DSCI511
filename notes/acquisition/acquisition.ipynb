    "## 3.1 APIs\n",
    "The entire infrastructure of the internet uses three basic ideas as building blocks: clients, servers, and requests. When you visit a website, your web browser is the _client_. In order to display the web page to you, your browser makes a _request_ to a remote _server_. The server then processes the request and sends back the page, which is essentially an HTML document. Your browser can interpret this document, which contains all kinds of information (including styling and presentation-related information and hyperlinks), and display it on your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 What is an API?\n",
    "An _Application Processing Interface_ (API) allows you to make a request to a remote server to obtain data instead of a web page. So instead of an HTML document, usually an API request will return some data in a format like, JSON, CSV, or XML. To review how to load data from these formats review Chapter 1."

    "### 3.1.2 Accessing APIs\n",
    "When you access a web page, your browser makes a request to the remote server. The browser uses a URL address to send the request. Similarly, URLs are also used to send requests to APIs. Usually, constructing the URL needed to send the request is an important early step in working with APIs.\n",
    "#### 3.1.2.1 Making Requests and handling JSON responses\n",
    "When writing Python code to get data from APIs, we'll use the `requests` module to make these requests. The `requests.get()` method can be supplied with a URL, and returns a \"response\" object, which has a very convenient `.json()` method to process the response when it is a JSON file and return a dictionary (so we don't necessarily have to use the `json` module to de-serialize a request's text result. For example, we'll use the GitHub API to grab some data about a user."

    "### 3.1.3 Working with CSV responses\n",
    "Sometimes API responses can be in CSV format, too. For example, the schedule data API for Center City regional arrivals by SEPTA returns CSVs. Since a CSV file is really just a text file, we can read the text from the response using a CSV reader. In the output below, showing the schedule data being displayed [here](http://www3.septa.org/ccstations/30th/) in CSV format, notice that the first line and the last two lines are not part of the table, rather messages and timestamps. Further, the CSV does not appear to have been written properly in the usual one-entry-per-line format. Rather, entries for trains on the same line are joined together. Irregularities like this are easy to miss, but can end up breaking your code."

    "The GitHub and SEPTA examples we've looked at so far are APIs that don't require any authentication to access. Anyone can send a request to these APIs and receive a response. There are, however, quite a few APIs that require the user to have some authentication. This authentication usually takes the form of an access token that needs to be obtained from the API provider before making requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Example: Sportradar\n",
    "As an example, we'll take a look at one of the [Sportradar APIs](https://developer.sportradar.com). Sportradar has APIs for a number of different sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use any of their APIs, Sportradar requires you to open a developer account and register an app. Only then you are granted an access token or \"API key\", which you must plug in to any requests you make.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to obtain an API key from Sportradar are:\n",
    "1. Sign up as a developer [here](https://developer.sportradar.com/member/register)\n",
    "2. Sign in to your account and go your [account page](https://developer.sportradar.com/member/my-account)\n",
    "3. Go to your [applications page](https://developer.sportradar.com/apps/myapps)\n",
    "4. Register a new application and select the API keys you need\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Sportradar Soccer API to obtain the match schedule for an English soccer team, Manchester City.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll construct the request address using the API key."

    "### 3.3 Big Tech APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Large tech companies make a variety of APIs available for use. Most of these require authentication and can be used to access some very useful data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Facebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook has an API called the Graph API that allows a developer to access data about posts, comments, users and more. However, one of the major sticking points of working with APIs from companies like Facebook is that these APIs change very frequently, and sometimes the changes can break a developer's code. Facebook changed their policy towards applications some time ago, and as a result, a developer simply working on a research project is not allowed access to any data from the Graph API. In order to gain data access, all developers must register their application and go through a review process with Facebook. Only then is data collection allowed through the API. These barriers make it hard to discuss and work with the Graph API. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Google\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Google Maps has a very powerful API that can be used to obtain a large variety of data, however, it is meant to be used as a licensed resource for which developers pay Google a fee. Some of Google's tools may be used for free by obtaining a \\$200 API credit, however, this still requires setting up billing. If you are interested in these tools, take a look [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration when working with these APIs is that companies usually enforce a \"rate limit\". This means a developer is only allowed to make calls under a certain frequency. When you are working with an API from a commercial entity, make sure to check on their rate limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.3 Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "A big-tech API we can demonstrate and play around with is the Twitter API. While the API can be accessed in a barebones way usings tools such as the `requests` module, we can also use an API client, which is a third-party library that allows us to easily work with an API by automating and simplifying low-level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Twitter, we'll use a client called Twython (`pip3 install Twython` to install). First, we'll need to follow these steps to obtain API access and authentication: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign up for a Twitter account\n",
    "2. Sign in to [https://apps.twitter.com]\n",
    "3. Create an app\n",
    "4. Go to the API Keys section and click \"Generate ACCESS TOKEN\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting keys are:\n",
    "- \"oauth_access_token\"\n",
    "- \"oauth_access_token_secret\"\n",
    "- \"consumer_key\"\n",
    "- \"consumer_secret\"\n",
