    "## 7.1 Rate limiting\n",
    "A _rate limit_ refers to a specific rate at which the owner of a source of data allows other internet users to obtain that data. Some sources of data have no rate limit (which is probably a bad idea, potentially allowing for easy DoS attacks), but on most sites you'll encounter they'll have one. Each site sets their own limits, and they often vary wildly from platform to platform (or even on a single platform over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1.1 Rate limiting with APIs\n",
    "If you're using an API to collect data there'll almost certainly be a rate limit. When APIs are more commoditized/commercialized their platforms will generally reflect this with more watchfull behaviors that shut your app down quickly. While your app might depend on a particular rate limit, it's not uncommon for these to change, too. For example, the Facebook Graph API used to have a limit of about 3600 calls per hour for any app in development more, but it reduced this to 200 in 2018 with v.3). Generally, it is the duty of the collector to be diligent of rate limits both as a kindness to hosts and to make streams robust. This means following details on rate limiting in the documentation for the data you are working with. For example, current pointers to Twitter and Facebook are here:\n",
    "- Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/advanced/rate-limiting/\n",
    "- Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limiting.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.1.2 Exercise: Understanding API rate limits\n",
    "Read each of the above API docs and describe the how much API usage is allowed per day from each platform for a given app. Do all apps get the same bandwidth? What methods/metrics do the platforms use to determine limits and overuse? How should an app be constructed to maximize data access?"

    "#### 7.1.1.3 Monitoring API Rate Limits\n",
    "When it comes to APIs, the actual process of obtaining the data itself is usually\n",
    "orders of magnitude easier than by writing scripts to scrape it, but this comes at the cost of oftentimes stricter and more complicated rate limiting. Also, APIs and their rate limits can change at any moment! So, it's definitely important to check the documentation of the API you're using very frequently, and to become very familiar with it. This is the place (usually) to find the rate limiting information for the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, there are several components to API rate limiting. For example, on the Facebook Graph API there are three separate categories that you need to look out for (on an hourly basis): total number of calls, total time used, and the total CPU usage. If your script goes over any of these three categories in an hour, then you'll be locked out of further use of the API until the next hour. Unfortunately, this means that if we want to remain within the rate limits, we need to do a lot more work than just setting some sleep call. We might be tempted to just run a few calls, note how much of each category these calls \"use up\", then divide an hour by these figures to get the number of calls we might be allowed per hour. But this isn't a good idea, because every call is different. Some may take up a lot of CPU power, while others take up very little.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we deal with these rate limits? Luckily, most APIs have a method that will, when queried, return to the user various statistics regarding current API usage. A good solution to our problem is to have our script request these statistics after each call, and make sure to only continue making calls while under the rate limits. For a transparent example we'll use the Facebook Graph API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the Facebook example code will not run unless you authenticate with application and access tokens and pass application review and hence has more value for use conceptually. Information on these processes can be found through the (very dense) graph api documentation."

    "First, we should pick upper limits for the various rate limit categories so that the script will stop running once they are hit. Upon examining the documentation, we see that the rate limiting data for the three categories are returned as percentages, so once we hit 100% on any of the three categories, the API will be shut off for the rest of the hour. So, to be extra careful, let's tell our script to shut off once any of these categories hits 95%. Next, we need to figure out how to get the rate limit data itself! It turns out that this data is returned with all API calls as an _HTML header_. Basically, this is an extra bit of information (request metadata) that can come along with URL requests. To get the response headers from a urllib response, simply invoke the method: `response.info()`.\n",

As we have it set up, if there's some kind of bug or error which stops the execution of the script, it will go unnoticed until someone decides to manually check up on it. This could mean you haven't been collecting data for days, weeks, or even months! It would be nice, and give us peace of mind, to create an additional mechanism solely dedicated to checking up on our stream, and in case it goes down for some reason, restarting it. This is made easy with the `os` Python module, and a feature on UNIX-like systems called `top`.\n",

Usually, a simple solution to fix this problem is to just go into the process manager (by pressing `ctrl + alt + del`), and end the process, then restart it back up. This is exactly what we'd like to do with our stream script, but we need to find a way to automate it. Fortunately, there are multiple process managers in UNIX-like systems akin to the Windows process manager. For this example, we'll just use one of the most basic ones available: `ps` (many people use `htop` or`top` but ps has simpler output). The output of `ps` will yield a line for each process currently running.\n",

    "Note: this example is intended to generalize process monitoring to environments where all that is available is text output on active/inactive processes, like on a cluster's queue.

While the regex approach with `ps` is one that we can generalize to other process-monitoring scenarios, we can use `psutil` to much more easily get a list of our processes on a single machine.
